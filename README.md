# BotDuck
Open Source Twitch Chat Bot built using PIrcBotX

# Usage
You should be able to download the sources and compile with your login and OAuth code and run the bot. You don't have to have a second account, but you can.

To run the bot open a command prompt and type "java -jar /path/to/jar.jar <your channel name>" without the quotes. The bot will then join your channel!

# Features
The bot is essentially a nightbot clone, but with one key difference. It has points! Each user has points and once they reach 72 (the eqivalent of six hours in chat) they become a regular and are
exempt from all spam protection.

# Contribution
If you are contributing to the code through Pull Requests make sure to REMOVE YOUR OAUTH from BotDuck.java. If you do not the PR will be imediately closed and you will be reminded to change your OAuth. This is for your protection, not mine.
